# ZOD-COD-Clone -> reCreating childhood game COD zombie app

Engine: Unity

Language: C#

Developer: Just me and myself only

Since this is a project that requires Unity3D, I had to relearn about spacing in Unity.
I've created 2D games with Unity, However moving it from 2D to 3D is a big challenge.

I searched about COD zombie on youtube and Google. There were alot of example codes and videos. 
However trying to make my own will be a fun challenge.

Starting from April 13, I will be using about a week to create this game.
